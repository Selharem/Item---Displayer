# Item-Displayer

This is a simple web app built with nodejs, express and mongoDB. It displays items added into the database. 
You can contribute to the app if you'd like to !

# Getting Started

• Install nodejs and npm.

• Create a new cluster on MongoDB (you can use mongoDB atlas without installing anything into your machine).

• Copy the link to your cluster and paste it on config/keys.js.

• Checkout the repository onto your local machine.

• Use Postman to make HTTP Requests (or any other tool).

• Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

• Run `npm run dev` to run the app.

# Happy Coding
